## Research Interests
I am studying the dynamics of the tropical atmosphere and specifically how the dynamics of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and its associated rain belt will change as we continue to add energy to the system (i.e., through greenhouse gas emissions). I am also interested in physical oceanography and planetary habitability on Earth and other planets.
